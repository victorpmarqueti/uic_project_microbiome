# Abstract

This study focuses on analyzing the vaginal microbiome in pregnant women to identify potential indicators of preterm birth. We use advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to explore the correlation between the microbiome composition and the incidence of births occurring before 37 weeks of gestation. Our findings seek to contribute to the broader understanding of maternal and infant health, potentially aiding in predicting and preventing preterm births.
